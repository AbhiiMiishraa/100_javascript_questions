# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language used to make **websites interactive and dynamic**. It allows you to add things like buttons that work when clicked, animations, pop-up messages, and other features that make websites more engaging. 

In simple terms, it's what makes websites not just "look" good but also "work" in fun and useful ways. For example, when you type something in a form and click "Submit," JavaScript helps send that data to the website's server or shows a message like "Thanks for submitting!" without refreshing the page.

JavaScript works in web browsers like Chrome or Firefox, so it runs directly on your computer while you're browsing.
